    <pre>
    
    Since there was no institution of higher education in Kailali
     district before 2037 BS, the absence of educational 
     opportunities after SLC created an urgent social demand 
     for establishment of a campus in the district. 
    Prior to the establishment of Kailali Multiple Campus (KMC), 
    most of the students of this region had to go to Kathmandu or India 
    for further studies after SLC. 
    The people of Kailali thus took initiation for
     establishing KMC in 2037 BS.

KMC has now become largest community based campus 
of Nepal with more than 9 thousand students. 
Since its establishment, KMC has produced thousands 
of students with sound academic skills who have been 
serving in several aspects of life within the country and abroad. 
 The campus is located in picturesque and peaceful 
 surroundings in the eastern part of Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City.

KMC is an autonomous, community based and non-profit 
organization established solely with the view to provide
 higher education to the   educationally backward areas of the country.
 Affiliated to Tribhuvan University and Farwestern University, KMC has been the 
 center of excellence in higher education and has proven 
 itself reliable institution due to quality education, 
 adequate physical infrastructures, affordable fee and 
 convenient location in Far-western Region.

In the last 42 years of its establishment, 
KMC has set several landmarks in educational history of
 not only Far Western Region but the country as a whole. 
The award of Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) 
certificate by University Grants Commission (UGC) for 
its excellence in higher education is the recent achievement of KMC.
 A new milestone was added in the history of Kailali
  Multiple Campus on December 2015, when the campus 
  was ranked number one by UGC among the 60 community campuses of Nepal selected
  for Higher Education Reform Project (HERP) under 
  the assistance of the World Bank.
